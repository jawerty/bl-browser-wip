# TODO
- (done) Set up browser shell 
- (done) Build out Query UI (the sidebar)
	- (done) Make it toggleable
	- One per Tab view? or one which content changes on tab change?
	- Add current page query chat and link query chat
	- (done) Add search box and toggle for raw/qa
- (done) Build content scraper class (text only)
	- (done) Isolate Content Regions
		- (done) Make Context Series Data Structure
	- General Scraper
		- Scoring Algorithm
			- (done) Get all elements that contain text 
			- (done) Check whether it's content
				- Content score each piece of text you get on the page
				- log(wordCount) * (amountOfLinks + text descriptors) 
				- text descriptors
					- bold
					- italic
					- starts with capital letter
					- log(special characters count)
					- log(non nouns in text)
		- (done) cut of text under score and order by highest to lowest
	- (done) communicate scored text data to Query UI browser view
- (done) Create quick and dirty raw search UI 
	- Use as groundwork for QA search UI
	- How to present found results?
	- Is the chat bot going to look like you're talking to it
- Start building QA model pipeline
	- How to embed python scripts in electron process
		- run python binaries throgh child_process
	- Create the model loader/saver
	- Create the "inference bot"
		- the binary that is executed to complete the user's queries
- Handle query ui in multiple tabs
- Get it working for basic in page RAW/QA queries


- (partially done) Solve speed issue 
	- Work with other models
	- (done) Use a smaller model
	- Fine a well documented model and figure out how it was trained and why inference would be slow
	- (done) passage ranking

- ***Build link query functionality***
	- (partially done) Research how to do quicker vector comparisons before running inference
		- Only run inference on a few different contexts 
	- Add functionality to content scraper class to get all content links 
	- (done) Only do link search on right click open
		- Opens QueryEditor on the page (same component mounted in page)
			- Kinda sucks
		- Opens it in the query form
		- Only have one query form
	- Create result reveal option for deep linking

	- Build deep search functionality
		- (done) How to scrape content of content
		- (done) Use headless browser in background?
		- How to do recursive search?
			- get all content links on page in preload routine
				- mapping of content link and context paragraph
				- filter links by content score of parent doc
			- run search routine for link
				- raw - check for matching doc and recursively check each link until it's found (dumb search, filter links)
				- qa 
					- determine threshold for a good match
						- threshold is the inference score
					- run sentence cosine similarity on each link paragraph and query vector
					- from the top links down run search routine until threshhold is reached
					- if it isn't react do the next link
		- how to intelligently get/filter links of importance
		- how to parallel process scraping routines
		- Gather them together in a logical sequence (use ML for this?)
		- Run same RAW/QA query logic with this larger corpus 
	- (done) Right click menu option on link to auto-reveal query chat in sidebar
	- Add logic to jump to url where content was found (important if possible)

- Concepts/Topics page
	- View a break down of all the concepts/topics on the page
	- Detect concept in what you wrote 
- Link query collections
	- Make bookmark collections and query them 
	- third tab?
	- Option next to search?
- Settings page

- Wrap up
	- Work through browsing experience features
		- Think through all features to make it good to browse
	- Work on design thoroughly
	- Write installer/build scripts
		- Need to install python3/pip packages/qa model

(PROTOTYPE done)
- Next steps
	- Add content labeling model
		- filter content by content type
		- talk to AI using content type lingo (show me x comments)
	- Network analysis
		- build and integrate whattracker knowledge
